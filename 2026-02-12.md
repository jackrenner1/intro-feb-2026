### Coupling and Cohesion

Writing code using the four rules of simple design.

- This section seems to be about testing, and it is. But it also contains the secrets to life, death, the universe, and well, everything! STAY FROSTY!
- After we do this, we'll be in a much better place to understand the code we've written in the API, how we can move it forward, add tests, and move on to other programming languages and platforms (like Angular!)



### Daily Quiz


1. When do we use the async/await pattern (that your instructor hasn't even explained yet) in our C# code?
    - To perform non-blocking operations, Whenever you make an endpoint that reaches out to another resource(service,database, etc)
    - Async on function header, await on resource call
2. What is Open API?
    - Standard language format for RESTful APIs in JSON (and YAML)
    - What is Scalar? (The thing we added to AppHost)
        - Wrapper for Open API (updated version of swagger) that makes the json look nice and provides endpoint testing
3. Why did we use an Http DELETE method in our `student/moments` endpoint when we really didn't "delete" anything?
    - One of the four HTTP request types and DELETE fit the best
    - Mark MM that have been answered, removing it from the returned table, modifying it
4. Consider the following code we created yesterday:

```csharp
 public static async Task<IResult> MarkQuestionAnswered(Guid id, IDocumentSession session)
    {
        // ...
    }
```

- How is our API being made "aware" that this is the code it should run when receiving an Http DELETE request to `student/moments/b0f17531-ca09-41dd-8654-d0eb180f6797` (for example)?
    - Controllers: Using annotations
    - Not Controllers: Using MapDelete in ApiExtensions
- Where are the `id` and `session` variables coming from when this method is executed?
    - The request, each request is a different session
    - ? Please explain more (where session comes from)
- If the API received a request of `DELETE /student/moments/bird-cage` what would the value of `id` be when this code is executed (uhm, might be a trick question), but explain your answer.
    - ID gets defaulted to 0000...
    - It produces a 404 error, because it can't run (can't cast to GUID)
- The database provider we are using here calls it a "session", sometimes it's called a "context", and ASP.NET MVC (our platform for building APIs) calls it
    a "scope". But they all mean basically the same thing in this context, which is:
    - Transaction, Lifespan of a request, it either does all the things or none of them.
