# Use the Rest of the Day To:

- Try TDD - Kata 2 - You can use my code as a reference.
- But what I really want you doing is thinking about this test double thing.
- [Instructions Here](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-2)
- Take my code, look at it. Read it. Debug it. 
- BUILD AS MUCH OF THIS MENTAL MODEL AS YOU CAN.
- At least get to the point where you can verbalize something close to a question.

- Why do we use test doubles?
To isolate the code being tested by replacing slow, unpredictable, or complex dependencies.

- What is a test double?
A stand‑in object used during testing to mimic a real dependency in a controlled way.


- Extra Credit: what is meant by a dummy, stub, mock, or fake.

A dummy fills a parameter but isn’t used.
A stub returns fixed data.
A mock verifies that certain interactions occurred.
A fake is a lightweight working version of a real component.

- Why is this so important?
It makes tests faster, more reliable, and easier to write by removing dependency complexity.

- This is not the question: That you can do this on your own 100%
